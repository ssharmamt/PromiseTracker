  <p>
    Our effort is to enable voters to monitor the performance of their governments. 


  </p>
  <p>We will also assess if governments adhere to all of their promises in regard to education, health, economy, agriculture, transparency, law and order, minority rights, culture, and many more. </p>
<p>
  Currently, we are tracking the performance of Bharatiya Janta Party led Central Government and Aam Aadmi Party led Government of Delhi.
